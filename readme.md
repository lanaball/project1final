Hi Behshad,
This is my website about coffee. This is my first ever website!
My index.html is my basic design mainly using grid. My about.html page is me exploring how to do things with html and css so its not exactly designed to be pretty.

All pages tested in browsers: Edge, Firefox, Safari and Chrome.

I hope the css files are easy enough to navigate. I've tried to keep the main structures in the layout and all other parts in the components css file.

Just to note:
I have tried so many ways to get the prettier extension to work and it is not formatting my documents! So my apologies if its not formatted correctly I have done most of it by hand. 

My cart.html is my JS section and have tried to keep the navigation bar available so you can move around but nothing else is linked. 
For my Javascript section I have my JS set to defer and my styling is in the page not a separate css file. 

Javascript:
I first had to define my onclick function to say what i wanted the function to do, to get the text from the input section (data-input) and give it a value of a input. 
Then to get the input and make it an list element in the html file. 
Then I tell the JS that the list element (li) was then to be added to the list (ul). 
Then the li is appended (added) to the ul. 
Then to leave the input blank I leave the data-input value as blank
